1. Shortcuts for searching and navigating through source code
When working on a project with a large number of classes, locating 
members of a class can be a daunting and time-consuming task. 
However, with the right tools, this process can be significantly 
streamlined. In Visual Studio, there are several keyboard shortcuts 
that allow for quick and easy navigation and search operations. Let's 
take a look at these shortcuts that can help us perform quick searches
 and navigation.

Ctrl + Q: Displays Visual Studio Search
Ctrl + T: Displays the Go To All tool
Ctrl + -: Navigates backward between opened documents in the current session
Ctrl + Shift + -: Navigates forward between opened documents in the current session
F12: Navigates to a class definition
Alt + F12: Allows you to view and edit the code of a class in a pop-up window, from the code file you are writing.
Ctrl + F12: Navigates to the implementation of a member in a class
Ctrl + Shift + F12: Moves to the next error line when the error list window is open and more than one error is listed
F8: Navigates forward in the list of results of the current window
Shift + F8: Navigates backward in the list of results of the current window

2. Shortcuts for editing and refactoring
In this part, we will focus on the commands that enable direct changes
 to the source code. These commands are essential for carrying out 
 common operations such as renaming members, commenting on lines of
  code, and moving lines up and down.

Alt + Enter: Displays quick actions
Ctrl + K, Ctrl + I: Obtains information about a member of a class
Ctrl + K, Ctrl + C: Comments multiple selected lines in the source code
Ctrl + K, Ctrl + U: Uncomments multiple selected lines in the source code
Ctrl + Shift + L: Deletes selected lines
Ctrl + Shift + V: Displays and allows pasting the contents from the buffer ring (it refers to the history of elements that have been previously copied)
Ctrl + F: Finds a specific text in the code
Ctrl + A: Selects all the lines in the current file
Ctrl + S: Saves the pending changes in the current file
Ctrl + Shift + S: Saves the pending changes in all the opened files
Ctrl + Shift + .: Zooms into the current file
Ctrl + Shift + ,: Zooms out from the current file
Ctrl + Up: Moves selected lines up in a code file
Ctrl + Down: Moves selected lines down in a code file
Ctrl + K, Ctrl + D: Applies the style rules to the entire document
Ctrl + K, Ctrl + F: Applies the style rules only in the selected lines in the document
Ctrl + K, Ctrl + S: Used to encapsulate the code between common clauses, such as cycles (while, for, and so on), control statements (if, switch, and so on), or code regions (#region).
Ctrl + R: Renames a member
Ctrl + R, Ctrl + E: Creates a property for a field of a class
Ctrl + R, Ctrl + G: Removes unused using statements in a class and sorts them alphabetically
Ctrl + R, Ctrl + M: Creates a method from the selected code
Ctrl + X: Cut line (empty selection)
Ctrl + /: Makes all that is highlighted commented
Ctrl + Home: Go to beginning of file

3. Shortcuts for debugging and testing
In Visual Studio, debugging and executing code are frequent tasks 
that we do. As such, it is crucial to familiarize ourselves with the 
keyboard shortcuts that can facilitate these operations and enable us 
to carry them out quickly and efficiently. Knowing these shortcuts can
save valuable time and boost productivity. So, let's take a look at the 
essential keyboard shortcuts that will help us execute code and debug
 with ease.

F5: Starts the application in debug mode
Ctrl + F5: Starts the application without debug mode
Shift + F5: Stops the application when it's running
Ctrl + Shift + F5: Stops the application execution, rebuilds the project, and creates a new debugging session
F9: Places or removes a breakpoint
F10: Skips the execution of code when debugging
F11: Debugs source code line by line
Shift + F11: Steps out of the execution of the method
Ctrl + R, Ctrl + A: Starts unit test execution in debug mode
Ctrl + R, A: Starts unit test execution without debug mode

4. The most common shortcuts for use in the IDE
When working in VS Code, it's not uncommon to accidentally close 
essential windows such as the Solution Explorer or Properties window 
and struggle to locate the option to reopen them. Therefore, being 
familiar with the keyboard shortcuts for frequently used windows and 
panels can save significant time and effort. Let's explore the essential
keyboard shortcuts that will help us move around the Visual Studio
IDE with ease.

Ctrl + Alt + L: Opens the Solution Explorer window
Ctrl + Alt + O: Opens the Output window.
Ctrl + \, E: Opens the Error List window
Ctrl + \, Ctrl + M: Opens the Team Explorer window.
Ctrl + Alt + B: Opens the Breakpoints window.
F4: Opens the Properties window.
Alt + F6: Allows you to scroll back between windows on the panels that are open.
Shift + Alt + F6: Allows you to scroll forward between windows on the panels that are open.

5. Shortcuts for file management
One of the key features of VS Code is its file management capabilities,
 which allow developers to efficiently create, open, edit, save, and 
 organize files and folders. VS Code provides a range of keyboard 
 shortcuts that enable developers to manage their files and folders 
 quickly and easily. These shortcuts include creating new files and 
 folders, opening and closing files, switching between open files, and 
 accessing the Explorer panel to view the file and folder structure of 
 the project. By using these shortcuts, you can save time, avoid errors, 
 and stay organized while working on their projects. Here is a list of 
 some of the most commonly used VS Code shortcuts for file 
 management:
